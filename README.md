##Install:

```npm install webpack -g```
```npm install```

##Serve:

```npm start```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so u can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser

##Test:
```npm test```

##Deploy:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
